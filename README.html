<h2 id="aboutthistheme">About this theme</h2>

<p>This is a starter theme I developed specifically for my needs. I grew tired of having to hack other themes so I decided to create one with code snippets I use the most and a file structure that works best with my workflow. It doesn&#8217;t have a lot of fancy bells and whistles, but that&#8217;s okay. I don&#8217;t need them. I want this theme to be as simple as possible. </p>
