## About this theme

This is a starter theme I developed specifically for my needs. I grew tired of having to hack other themes so I decided to create one with code snippets I use the most and a file structure that works best with my workflow. It doesn't have a lot of fancy bells and whistles, but that's okay. I don't need them. I want this theme to be as simple as possible.
